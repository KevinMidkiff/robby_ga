Notes:
------
Crossover:
    - Loop for range 0 to half of generations
        - Takes random sample of 15 out of the 200 individuals in the population
        - Take two with max fitness and reproduce them (parent1, parent2)
        - Does a crossover by with parent1 and parent2 splitting by by a random index and adding split halves from each parent
Mutation:
    - Loop through each number and produce a random number between 0 and 1
    - If gen value < than mutation rate, then choose random number to place (out of options) to place in the index
